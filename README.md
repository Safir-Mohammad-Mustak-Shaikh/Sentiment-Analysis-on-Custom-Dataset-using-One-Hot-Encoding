# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Custom-Dataset-using-One-Hot-Encoding

## Project Details:
This is a voluntary project, actually, it is one of my first Machine Learning projects. I have created a Machine Learning -> Deep Neural Network -> Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model for Sentiment Analysis on custom IMDB dataset.

## Project Team Members: 
SaÔ¨År Mohammad Shaikh

## Technologies Used:
* Language: Python

## How to Run?
1. Clone the Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Safir-Mohammad-Mustak-Shaikh/Sentiment-Analysis-on-Custom-Dataset-using-One-Hot-Encoding.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis-on-Custom-Dataset-using-One-Hot-Encoding
```
2. Unzip Dataset.7z

3. Run Model_LSTM.py file.
```sh
python3 Model_LSTM.py
```
***Note:** You can train the model from beginning or you can use already trained model by loading it.

## More Details:
The dataset is divided as
1. Training Data 80%
2. Validation and Testing Data 20%
