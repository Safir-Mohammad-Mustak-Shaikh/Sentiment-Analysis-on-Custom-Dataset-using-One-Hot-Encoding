# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Custom-Dataset-using-One-Hot-Encoding

## Project Details:
This is a voluntary project, actually, it is one of my first Machine Learning projects. I have created a Machine Learning -> Deep Neural Network -> Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model for Sentiment Analysis on custom IMDB dataset.

## Project Team Members: 
Saﬁr Mohammad Shaikh

## Technologies Used:
* Language: Python

## Dataset
A. L. Maas, R. E. Daly, P. T. Pham, D. Huang, A. Y. Ng, and C. Potts,“Learning  word  vectors  for  sentiment  analysis,”  inProceedings  ofthe   49th   Annual   Meeting   of   the   Association   for   ComputationalLinguistics: Human Language Technologies.   Portland, Oregon, USA:Association  for  Computational  Linguistics,  Jun.  2011,  pp.  142–150.[Online]. Available: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1015

## How to Run?
1. Clone the Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Safir-Mohammad-Mustak-Shaikh/Sentiment-Analysis-on-Custom-Dataset-using-One-Hot-Encoding.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis-on-Custom-Dataset-using-One-Hot-Encoding
```
2. Unzip Dataset.7z

3. Run Model_LSTM.py file.
```sh
python3 Model_LSTM.py
```
***Note:** You can train the model from beginning or you can use already trained model by loading it.

## More Details:
The dataset is divided as
1. Training Data 80%
2. Validation and Testing Data 20%
